# Introduction

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(ggformula)
library(infer)
library(broom) # Clean test results in tibble form
library(resampledata) # Datasets from Chihara and Hesterberg's book
library(openintro) # More datasets
library(nortest)
```

```{r}
set.seed(40)  # for replication
# Data as individual vectors ( for t.tests etc)
y <- rnorm(50, mean = 2, sd = 2)

# And as tibble too
mydata <- tibble(y = y)
mydata
```

```{r}
# Set graph theme
#theme_set(new = theme_custom())
#
mydata %>%
    gf_density(~y) %>%
    gf_fitdistr(dist = "dnorm") %>%
    gf_labs(title = "Densities of Original Data Variables", subtitle = "Compared with Normal Density")
```

### Inference

-   t-test:

```{r}
t1 <- mosaic::t_test(
          y, # Name of variable
          mu = 0, # belief of population mean
          alternative = "two.sided") %>% # Check both sides
  
  broom::tidy() # Make results presentable, and plottable!!
t1
```

## Case Study 2: Exam Data

```{r}
data("exam_grades")
exam_grades
```

### Inspecting and Charting data

```{r}
exam_grades %>%
    gf_density(~course_grade) %>%
    gf_fitdistr(dist = "dnorm") %>%
    gf_labs(title = "Density of Course Grade", subtitle = "Compared with Normal Density")


```

### Testing Assumptions

```{r}
stats::shapiro.test(x = exam_grades$course_grade) %>%
    broom::tidy()
```

```{r}
library(nortest)
# Especially when we have >= 5000 observations
nortest::ad.test(x = exam_grades$course_grade) %>%
    broom::tidy()
```

### Inference

-   t-test:

```{r}
t4 <- mosaic::t_test(
          exam_grades$course_grade, # Name of variable
          mu = 80, # belief
          alternative = "two.sided") %>% # Check both sides
broom::tidy()
t4
```
